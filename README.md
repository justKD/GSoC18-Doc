This repository aggregates all of the work I did for [Google Summer of Code 2018](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) with [Systers Open Source](http://systers.io/).

It contains only my own work and only as it existed at the end of the project.

For details, links to project repos, and links to live apps, please see the documentation site at:
